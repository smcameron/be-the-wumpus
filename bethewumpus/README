HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:

Apart from a working stereo sound card,
HEADPHONES ARE *HIGHLY* RECOMMENDED.

You will also need a dual axis joystick, such as the 
Logitech Dual Action 2 with Rumble.

The rumble feature does not work, sorry to say.


BUILDING:

To build, just type "make".

You will need libportaudio (http://www.portaudio.com/)
and libsndfile (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)
if you don't already have them on your system.

You will need oggdec to decode the ogg files into
wav files (vorbisutils package).

You will need 80Mb of disk space for the 
decoded wav files.

You will need gtk-2.0 libs as well.  GTK could
probably be dispensed with, as it is used mainly
for debugging, and for the timer loop, but it would
take a little bit of hacking on the code to get it there.
