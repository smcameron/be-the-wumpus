"Be The Wumpus" was written by Stephen M. Cameron

This game was inspired by reading about "In the Pit",
from Studio Hunty.  (See: http://www.studiohunty.com/itp/ )

This game (Be The Wumpus) is almost certainly an inferior 
version of that game (In the Pit), though I have never 
played, seen (or heard) In the Pit, so that is only a guess,
based on the fact that I'm just an amateur at game programming.  

I didn't have any Windows machine, or any wired Xbox controller 
when I read about "In the Pit" (still don't) so I couldn't play 
it, but the description of the game was very interesting, and I 
thought anyway I'd likely have more fun programming the game
than playing it, and certainly learn more.  And so it seems I
have.

I hope somebody enjoys this thing a little bit.

Happy chomping.
