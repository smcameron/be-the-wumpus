done  * Make cave wanderer move 
done  * Give cave wanderer an anxiety level
done  * Add water areas and splashing noises
done  * Fix divide by zero bug and infinitely loud things.
      * add meal aggression
done  * Add levels
done  * Add eating noises
      * Add level win intermission of some sort (done... but very lamely.)
      * Add game over intermission of some sort
done  * Recompute sound volumes on entry to sound callback, rather than
        only when sounds are initated, so the stereo field won't jump
	around, but will rotate smoothly.  This one is important.
done  * allow different cave wanderers on each level, instead of just
	the same one over and over.
