HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:

Apart from a working stereo sound card,
HEADPHONES ARE *HIGHLY* RECOMMENDED.

You will also need a dual axis joystick, such as the 
Logitech Dual Action 2 with Rumble.

The rumble feature does not work, sorry to say.


BUILDING:

To build, just type "make".

You will need libportaudio (http://www.portaudio.com/ -- version 19, not 18)
and libvorbisfile (http://xiph.org) if you don't already have them on 
your system.

You will need gtk-2.0 libs as well.  GTK could
probably be dispensed with, as it is used mainly
for debugging, and for the timer loop, but it would
take a little bit of hacking on the code to get it there.
